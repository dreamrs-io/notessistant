	As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences, but here are some tips on finding good sources of great books:

1. Check out bestseller lists: Look at book recommendations from lists like The New York Times Best Sellers or Amazon's top books in various genres.

2. Online book clubs and forums: Join online book clubs or forums such as Goodreads or Reddit book club to receive recommendations and discussions on books.

3. Ask friends and family: Ask your family and friends for their favorite book recommendations.

4. Bookstores and libraries: Visit your local bookstores and libraries and look for staff picks or ask the librarians for recommendations.

5. Book review websites: Check out online book review websites such as Publishers Weekly and BookPage.

6. Awards and honors: Look for winners of literary awards like the Pulitzer Prize or National Book Award to discover great books.

7. Literary magazines: Read literary magazines to find new and emerging authors and their books. 

Remember, what makes a book great is subjective, so don't be afraid to explore different genres and authors until you find what appeals to you.
